When you use a browser to visit a website, the communication between your browser (client) and the server happens via the HTTP protocol. Here is how the request and response work:

Request-Response Cycle
Request: The browser constructs an HTTP request when you enter a web address or interact with web content. This request is sent to the server hosting the website, including details such as the path (which resource you want, e.g., /home, /about) and a verb (what you want to do, e.g., GET, POST) along with additional headers and possibly data.

Response: The server receives the HTTP request, processes it, and sends back an HTTP response. This response typically includes status information (such as 200 OK), headers, and possibly content (HTML, JSON, images, etc.) tailored to what was requested.

Common HTTP Request Methods
Method	Purpose
GET	Request data (read resource)
POST	Send data to create/update resource
PUT	Replace all current representations of the resource
PATCH	Apply partial modifications to a resource
DELETE	Remove the specified resource
HEAD	Similar to GET but only headers (no body)
OPTIONS	Describe communication options for the resource
CONNECT	Establish a tunnel (used for HTTPS via proxies)
TRACE	Debugging, message loop-back test
GET and POST are most commonly used by browsers; GET is for retrieving data, while POST is for submitting data.

How Browsers Match Responses to Requests
Each browser request is associated with a specific response over a TCP connection. In HTTP/1.0, one connection was used per request-response pair. HTTP/1.1 introduced persistent connections and pipelining, where multiple requests could be sent in series, and responses matched in order.

With HTTP/2, responses and requests can be multiplexed, allowing fragments of different responses to be interleaved but still matched with the correct request via stream identifiers.

Summary
A browser acts as a client sending HTTP requests to servers, which respond with HTTP responses. The method (GET, POST, etc.) determines the interaction, and protocols ensure each request is matched with its correct response for accurate page rendering.
